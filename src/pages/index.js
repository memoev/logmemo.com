          My name is Guillermo and I'm a software developer trying to share and document my journey throughout web development. This is a space where I'll be dropping notes, thoughts and articles about anything that revolves around technology and programming that I find relevant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Software developing can become complex and overwhelming task sometimes, but a fun and gratifying duty in the long run.

          Something that works a lot for me when trying to learn something new is writting down stuff <span role="img" aria-label="light-bulb">üí°</span>, since memory is a limited and valued resource. That's the main reason why I'm creating this website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most things I write are not meant to be professional heavy documents or papers, but just a set of key words that make sense with some examples, which allows me to link things in my head.
