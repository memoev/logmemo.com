          My name is Guillermo and I'm a software developer trying to document and share my journey throughout web development. This is a space where I'll be dropping notes, thoughts and articles about anything I find relevant revolving around technology and programming.

          Software developing can become complex and a overwhelming task at times, but a fun and gratifying duty in the long run. Since memory is a limited and valued resource, something that works a lot for me when trying to learn new things is writting down stuff <span role="img" aria-label="light-bulb">ðŸ’¡</span>, and that's the main reason why I'm creating this website, leaving my old one behind, I wanted something more simple and personal.

          Most things I write are not meant to be professional documents or heavy detailed papers, but just a set of key words that make sense which allows me to link things in my head, along some examples.
